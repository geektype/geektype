## Hi, I'm Abdullah 👋
### A DevOps and Cloud nerd based out of London

You will find me working on scripts and tooling that make the development experience *slightly* better 😉

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Dependy](https://github.com/geektype/dependy) to automate the effort required to keep our numerous dependencies up to date accross all teams
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any small/medium project
- 💬 Ask me about anything and everything Cloud and DevOps 🙂
- 📫 How to reach me: **TBD**

### 2024 Goals

* New Languages
  * ☁️ **Go** - The VW Passat of the programming world. It Gets the job done™
  * 🦀 **Rust** - Obtain enough clout to be able to say *"I code in Rust BTW"*
* Actually finish a personal project 🤞
* Make the terminal my new home 💻
